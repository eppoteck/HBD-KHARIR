    <p class="note">Do you know what's make sad? When I never communicate with you, even I meet you is impossible. Praying for you is my way of loving you even without your knowledge. I love you because I think it's not easy to get your heart. Sometimes I miss you. I can't forget when we often communicate smoothly and joke with you. Those memories are still attached to my heart. I will always wait for you. It doesn't matter if we never meet and communicate. As long as the final chapter is you. Take care of yourself and keep healthy</p>
